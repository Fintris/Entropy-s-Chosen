This allows you to run faster and, if you are §esneaking§r as you land, avoid fall damage, but your maximum health is slightly decreased, you cannot use a §eShield§r, and armor and armor toughness only provide half their usual benefit. \nYour strange skin and lack of lungs provide an immunity to thorns, suffocation, Regeneration and Instant Health."
