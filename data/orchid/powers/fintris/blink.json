	"description": "Activate while sprinting for a medium-range teleport. The teleport is slightly delayed, creating a rift at your destination and freezing you in place briefly before occurring. If you are damaged during this delay, the blink will be cancelled.\nIf the blink is not interrupted by a block, the rift will become §bcharged§r, turning blue instead of purple. Teleporting very close to an enemy with a §bcharged§r rift will cause a §bpower surge§r, granting you §3Starlight§r and a short boost that increases speed and damage by 50%.",
